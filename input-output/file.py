#File handling in Python

#Best way to open a file
#File will automatically be closed when the nest code block completes

#Use a+ to create a new file if it does not exist and prevent destructive overwrite
with open("data.txt", "a+") as data :
    #file is now open
    #work on file
    data.read()

#writing to a file
with open("data.txt", "w+") as data:
    #file is now open
    #work on file
    data.write("This is the first line of the text in the file\n")
    data.write("This is the second line of the text in the file\n")
    data.write("This is the third line of the text in the file\n")
    data.write("This is the fourth line of the text in the file\n")

#Reading contents of a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as data:
    #read data from the entire file
    print(data.read())

print("\n")

#Read first n characters from a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as data:
    #read first n characters
    print(data.read(15))

print("\n")

#Read from the file one line at a time
with open("data.txt", "r") as data:
    #read data one line at a time
    print(data.readline() + " - Line 1")
    print(data.readline() + " - Line 2")
    print(data.readline() + " - Line 3")

print("\n")

#data as a list and loop over
with open("data.txt", "r") as data:
    for line in data:
        print(line)


#Read all lines at once

.seek(offset, from_what)
offset - Number of characters from the from_what parameter

2 - end of the file
